# Currency Rates

Minimalistic currency rates web app (with converter feature), with 150+ currencies available. Web app was made in `React` with `Bootstrap`, and deployed on `Netlify`. Currency rates are fetched from `currency-api` (see **Credits** for more info). Goal of this project was to see how does `react-router` works.
